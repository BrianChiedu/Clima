# Clima

## Description
IOS weather app that gives users live weather information based on their current location or the location they enter to a textfield. This live data is gotten from the OpenWeather API and parsed into a swift object to
be used in the program. The app is dark-mode enabled and it implements Apple's delegate design pattern. Also, in compliance with privacy policies the app prompts users to opt in or out of sharing their GPS location
before phone location is retrieved. This app was made for iphones and additional features as well as an android version will be released in the coming months.

## Demo
